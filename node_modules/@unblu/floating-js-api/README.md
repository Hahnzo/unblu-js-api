# Unblu Floating JS API
The Floating JS API is an optional add-on to the Unblu Floating UI site integration.
It allows JavaScript access to the local Floating Unblu UI integration.

## Installation
In your project execute the following command which will install the `floating-js-api` and add it to the `package.json` file as a dependency.
```bash
npm install --save @unblu/floating-js-api
```
The `floating-js-api`'s version is synchronized with the Unblu Collaboration Server version.
To guarantee compatibility between the two, use the latest JS library version that is either equal to or smaller than the Collaboration Server version you are using.

Once installed you can use it like so:

```js
import unblu from "floating-js-api";

const api = await unblu.floating.api.initialize();
// use the floating API
```
